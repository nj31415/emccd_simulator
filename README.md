# emccd_simulator
(EM)CCD Detector Simulation project repository. Code to simulate an EMCCD detector (along with standard CCD output) implemented in MATLAB. The EMCCD_Sim folder contains the MATLAB code required for running the model. The model is operated by running driver scripts. The MATLAB scripts ending in \_Driver provide examples of how to use and run the model.

Developed using MATLAB 2022a. Requires the Statistics and Machine Learning and Parallel Computing Toolboxes.
